      My name is Manara Ali, I am originally from West Africa and I am many
      things. I am a father, a brother and a student of life!
      <br />
      I love sport and soccer in my favorite of all time. My friends say I am a
      fanatic; I would not disagree with them. I love to code, but I get stuck a
      lot and sometimes don't really know what to do. When that happens, I use
      <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>, to find ressources to help me
      solve that particular issue.
